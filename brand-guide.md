# The Artist Bungalow - Brand Guide v2

## Brand Name
**The Artist Bungalow**
_Light Filled Artist Bungalow | Hollywood Hills_

## Tagline
"Where the hills meet the music."

## Brand Essence
Classic Hollywood glamour meets mid-century modernism meets California warmth. An intimate, art-filled retreat perched in the Hollywood Hills, steps from the legendary Hollywood Bowl. Sophisticated but fun, bold but sun-drenched, editorial but personal.

## Design Direction
Stahl House clean lines + Chateau Marmont storied warmth + Eames playful geometry + Palm Springs golden hour. Never sterile, never corporate. The visual language of a well-traveled creative who knows good design but doesn't take themselves too seriously.

## Tone of Voice
- Warm, personal, never corporate
- Blend of property-centric and second-person guest-focused voice
  - Property as protagonist for descriptions: "A retreat perched in the hills..." / "The bungalow sits steps from the Hollywood Bowl..."
  - Second-person for experiential moments: "Your mornings start with canyon light..." / "Step onto the deck and the city unfolds below you..."
- No host names or personal host identity (keep hosts private)
- Conversational but polished
- Local expertise, casual authority
- Evocative, sensory language (light, breeze, views, warmth)
- No em dashes anywhere
- Short sentences. Confident pacing.
