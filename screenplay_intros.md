# Artist Bungalow - Screenplay Intros (Tightened)

Six rotating intros for the splash page. Each follows a three-beat structure: setting, detail, payoff. The closing line always nods to the feeling of the place.

## 1.
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS – DAY

Sun over the canyon. Palm trees stand still.
A bungalow perched above the city. White stucco. Clean lines.
The kind of place that feels like yours the moment you walk in.

## 2.
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS – GOLDEN HOUR

Jasmine on the breeze. A canyon stretched out below, glowing.
A bungalow. Spanish stucco. A piano through an open window.
The kind of place you find and never want to leave...

## 3.
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS – DAY

WIDE ON the canyon. A hawk circles.
PUSH IN on a bungalow above it all. Views for miles. A guitar leaning against a chair.
The kind of place where every morning feels like the opening scene.

## 4.
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS – MAGIC HOUR

The city sprawls. The hills don't care.
A bungalow above the noise. Art on the walls. Light through every window.
The kind of place you keep coming back to.

## 5.
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS – SUNSET

Canyon light. The distant sound of the Bowl tuning up.
A bungalow tucked into the hillside. A deck with nowhere better to be.
The kind of place that makes you wonder why you'd ever leave...

## 6.
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS – DAWN

Fog in the canyon. The city still asleep.
A bungalow above the clouds. A view that earns the climb.
The kind of place where you finally stop scrolling and start living.
